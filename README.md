# Simple Content Management System
A simple web based content management system. don't mess it up, store all content in one system.

### Perpose
Many people and company who own multiple sites upload a image once to there core website and src from sub sites to the core website. Then they change there core website and all sub sites and applications are broken!

Fix it by managing all content in one system. seperated from all your websites!

I'm building the panel on a live website. Test it if you like to!

Reminder: It's a live development enviroment. When I start working on uploading files I'll change the password and stop the demo.
